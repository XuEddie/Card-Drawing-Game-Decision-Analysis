# Card-Drawing-Game-Decision-Analysis
Data analysis and modeling project exploring factors influencing player decisions in card-drawing games, using a questionnaire and random-forest model to evaluate impacts on satisfaction and decision-making behavior.

## feature_importance.py
This script analyzes the importance of different features in predicting satisfaction using a Random Forest Regressor.

## satisfaction_vs_draw_ratio.py
This script visualizes the relationship between satisfaction and the ratio of total draws to expected draws for samples where the character was obtained.

## satisfaction_vs_total.py
This script predicts and visualizes the relationship between satisfaction and the percentage of total draws relative to guaranteed draws using a Random Forest Regressor.

## total_vs_already.py
This script clusters players based on their draw ratios and visualizes the clusters using a scatter plot.

## total_vs_available.py
This script visualizes the relationship between total draws and available draws ratios for player risk analysis using a scatter plot.

## total_vs_expected.py
This script visualizes the relationship between total draws and expected draws ratios for player risk analysis using a scatter plot.
